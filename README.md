# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involved creating an interactive sales dashboard for a coffee shop using Microsoft Excel's Power Query and Pivot Tables. The objective was to analyze transactional data, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Pivot Tables**: For aggregating and summarizing data for visualizations.

---

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported transaction data into Power Query for preprocessing.

2. **Transformations**:
   - Extracted a new column `Size` from `product_details` to categorize sizes (e.g., `Sm` as `Small`, `Lg` as `Large`, etc.).
   - Created a new column `Total_Bill` by multiplying `transition_qty` and `unit_price`.
   - Modified the `transection_time` column to remove the incorrect date, retaining only time values.
   - Extracted `Month`, `Weekdays`, and `Hours` for temporal analysis from `transection_date` and `transection_time`.
   - Extracted numeric representations of weekdays and months for sequence-based sorting.

3. **Sales by Size**:
   - Donut chart illustrating sales distribution by cup sizes (e.g., Small, Regular, Large).
4. **Footfall Analysis**:
   - Line chart showing footfall trends by weekdays.
5. **Top-Selling Products**:
   - Bar chart highlighting the top 5 products based on total revenue.
6. **Store Location Analysis**:
   - Bar chart showing footfall distribution across store locations (e.g., Astoria, Lower Manhattan).
